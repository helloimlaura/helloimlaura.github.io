<p>Elmo has been our beloved family pet since she was a kitten. She is approximately eight to ten years old. Elmo is generally well tempered in the correct environment.
    She is spayed, vaccinated and healthy. She has had a full vet check up including a blood panel within the past month. <br>
    
    She loves to be outside, but she also loves a nice snuggle on a warm lap or on a blanket. She likes to hunt bugs and I think that she would also like to hunt mice. She is okay with riding in the car as long as she feels secure and reassured. She loves fish flavored canned food and tunafish. She also enjoys treats and one of her favorite pastimes is being brushed and pet with a paper towel roll.
    
    I would describe Cuda as loving, sweet, cuddly (sometimes), clean and well-mannered.
    
    Home visit is requested prior to adoption. $50 rehoming fee required.</p>
