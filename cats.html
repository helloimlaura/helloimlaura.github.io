                    This sweet and handsome boy has the softest fur, and he is ready to find a loving home! Nacho is about 7 years old, and came to our shelter when his elderly owner was no longer able to care for him. He is used to living in a quiet, calm home, so the transition to the stressful shelter environment has been a bit overwhelming for him! When in a home where he feels safe and comfortable, Nacho can be friendly, and enjoys petting and sitting in laps, but he can also be a shy guy. Nacho is not a fan of dogs so he needs a home without them, and due to his timid nature he also needs a home without any small kids in it. Once Nacho trusts you he is a very sweet boy and will come to you for petting and love, but he takes a long time to settle into a new environment, so he is looking for a patient and dedicated adopter who will give him all the time he needs to feel safe. Once he is settled and relaxed, Nacho likes to play with laser pointers and boxes, and loves to sit on the windowsill and nature watch. If you have the calm, laid back home Nacho has been looking for, ask how you can adopt this gorgeous kitty today!
